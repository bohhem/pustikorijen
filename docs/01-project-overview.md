# Pustikorijen - Project Overview

## Project Vision

A family relationship website designed for a small city in Bosnia, with the potential to grow into a bridge between the diaspora and homeland communities. The platform enables families to build collaborative genealogical trees, share stories, and maintain connections across borders.

## Project Name

**Pustikorijen** (meaning "roots" in Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian)

## Core Concept

- Family tree visualization for Bosnian families
- Connecting diaspora with homeland
- Multiple distinct family branches with same surnames
- Community-driven genealogical research
- Cultural preservation and storytelling

## Target Users

1. **Homeland Community**
   - Families still living in Bosnia
   - Local historians and genealogists
   - Community elders with family knowledge

2. **Diaspora Community**
   - Bosnians living abroad (Germany, USA, Sweden, Turkey, Austria, etc.)
   - Second and third generation descendants
   - People seeking to reconnect with their roots

## Key Differentiators

1. **Branch-Based Family Structure**
   - Multiple families with same surname can coexist
   - Geographic disambiguation (Sarajevo Hodžić vs Mostar Hodžić)
   - Clear separation prevents confusion

2. **Family Guru Governance**
   - Each branch has 1-3 "Gurus" (guardians)
   - Democratic but controlled access
   - Prevents data chaos while enabling collaboration

3. **Comprehensive Audit System**
   - Every change tracked
   - Source documentation
   - Dispute resolution workflow
   - Quality management

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Respects Bosnian naming conventions
   - Religious diversity awareness
   - War displacement sensitivity
   - Privacy-first approach

5. **Multilingual Support**
   - Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian
   - English
   - German (large diaspora)
