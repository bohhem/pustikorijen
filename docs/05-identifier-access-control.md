# Identifier System & Access Control

## 1. Multi-Level Identifier System

### Identifier Hierarchy

The system uses multiple identifier types for different purposes:

#### 1.1 Person ID (System Primary Key)

**Format:** `P-{UUID}`

**Example:** `P-a3f2b8c9-4d5e-6f7a-8b9c-0d1e2f3a4b5c`

**Purpose:**
- Immutable database primary key
- Never changes, even if person details change
- Used in all internal system references
- Not displayed to end users

**Generation:** Automatically created on person creation using UUID v4

#### 1.2 Family Branch ID

**Format:** `FB-{CITY_CODE}-{SURNAME}-{SEQ}`

**Examples:**
- `FB-SA-HODZIC-001` (Sarajevo Hod≈æiƒá family, branch 1)
- `FB-MO-HODZIC-001` (Mostar Hod≈æiƒá family, branch 1)
- `FB-TZ-MEHMEDOVIC-001` (Tuzla Mehmedoviƒá family, branch 1)

**Components:**
- `FB`: Fixed prefix (Family Branch)
- `CITY_CODE`: 2-letter city/region code
- `SURNAME`: Normalized surname (ASCII, uppercase, no diacritics)
- `SEQ`: 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.)

**Purpose:**
- Human-readable branch identification
- Disambiguate families with same surname
- Geographic origin tracking
- Used in UI, URLs, discussions

**City Codes Reference:**
```
SA = Sarajevo          BL = Banja Luka       TZ = Tuzla
MO = Mostar            ZE = Zenica           BI = Bihaƒá
PR = Prijedor          TR = Travnik          CA = Cazin
VI = Visoko            GO = Gora≈æde          FO = Foƒça
BR = Brƒçko             TE = Te≈°anj           GR = Graƒçanica
DO = Doboj             VG = Visegr√°d         SR = Srebrenica
```

#### 1.3 Person Reference Code (Human-Readable)

**Format:** `{BRANCH_ID}/{INITIALS}-{BIRTH_YEAR}`

**Examples:**
- `FB-SA-HODZIC-001/AH-1920` (Ahmed Hod≈æiƒá, born 1920)
- `FB-MO-HODZIC-001/MH-1890` (Mehmed Hod≈æiƒá, born 1890)

**Purpose:**
- Easy reference in discussions, disputes, emails
- Unique within branch
- Human-friendly
- Visible in audit logs

**Display Format:**
```
Short: AH-1920
Full:  FB-SA-HODZIC-001/AH-1920
```

#### 1.4 Generation Code

**Format:** `G{NUMBER}` (relative to branch root)

**Examples:**
- `G1` = Root ancestor(s)
- `G2` = Children of root
- `G3` = Grandchildren of root
- `G4` = Great-grandchildren, etc.

**Purpose:**
- Tree navigation
- Relationship calculations
- Generation-based filtering
- Statistical analysis

#### 1.5 URL Slug (SEO-Friendly)

**Format:** `{normalized-full-name}-{birth-year}`

**Example:** `ahmed-hodzic-1920`

**Purpose:**
- SEO-friendly URLs
- Shareable links
- Not guaranteed unique (uses Person ID as fallback)

**URL Examples:**
```
/person/ahmed-hodzic-1920
/branch/fb-sa-hodzic-001
/branch/fb-sa-hodzic-001/tree
/branch/fb-sa-hodzic-001/person/ahmed-hodzic-1920
```

## 2. Family Guru System

### What is a Family Guru?

A **Family Guru** is the guardian/administrator of a family branch. They ensure data quality, approve changes, resolve disputes, and represent the branch in site-wide matters.

### Guru Selection & Appointment

#### Method 1: Branch Founder (Automatic)

When someone creates a new family branch, they automatically become the **Primary Guru**.

**Requirements:**
- Create branch with root ancestor information
- Verify email address
- Provide initial family tree data (minimum 3 people)
- Accept Guru responsibilities agreement

**Verification:**
- Site admin may request identity verification
- May request evidence of family connection
- Phone/video verification for large branches

#### Method 2: Appointed by Current Guru

**Process:**
1. Primary Guru selects trusted family member
2. Invites them to Co-Guru role (max 2 co-gurus)
3. Nominee accepts invitation
4. 14-day notice period to branch members
5. Can be vetoed by 2/3 family vote (if 20+ active members)
6. If no veto, co-guru activated

**Requirements for Nominee:**
- Verified family member (in branch for 3+ months)
- Good contribution history (no disputes)
- Recommended: 10+ approved contributions

#### Method 3: Family Election

**Triggered by:**

Week 5: Transition
  - Winner announced
