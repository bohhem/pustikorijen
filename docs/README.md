## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

**Family Branch**: A distinct family lineage with the same surname, identified by geographic origin
- Format: `FB-SA-HODZIC-001` (Sarajevo Hod≈æiƒá family, branch 1)
- Allows multiple unrelated families with same surname to coexist

**Family Guru**: Guardian/administrator of a family branch
- 1-3 Gurus per branch
- Elected or appointed
- Responsible for data quality and dispute resolution

**Verification Levels**:
- ‚≠ê Unverified (user input)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê Community verified (2+ confirmations)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Document verified (certificates)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Expert verified (genealogist)
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Multi-source verified (3+ sources)

**Dispute Resolution**:
- Level 1: Family Discussion (7 days)
- Level 2: Family Guru Review (7 days)
- Level 3: Admin/Genealogist Panel (15 days)

### Trust Levels

   - Source documentation required
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms

4. **Diaspora Connection**
   - Multilingual interface (BSC, English, German)
   - Geographic visualization
   - Stories and memories sharing

5. **Scalability**
   - Start with single city
   - Expand to regional/national
   - Bridge to global diaspora
