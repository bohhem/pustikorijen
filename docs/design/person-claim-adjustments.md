## Person claim adjustments (2025-02-14)

- Allow branch members to self-claim people even when the profile already has partnerships or children.
- Block claims only if another branch has an approved link to the person or another user already has a pending claim.
- Preserve the founder’s guru role when claims are approved; never demote existing members, and auto-promote the founder if missing.
- Surface the “That’s me” affordance directly in the person card header so eligible users can claim without leaving the list.
