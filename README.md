## 📖 Key Concepts

### Family Branch
A distinct family lineage identified by geographic origin and surname.
- Format: `FB-{CITY}-{SURNAME}-{SEQ}`
- Example: `FB-SA-HODZIC-001` (Sarajevo Hodžić family, branch 1)

### Family Guru
Guardian/administrator of a family branch (1-3 per branch) responsible for:
- Approving changes
- Resolving disputes
- Maintaining data quality

### Tree Evolution
Family trees can grow upward when older ancestors are discovered, with automatic generation recalculation while preserving all data integrity.

## 🌐 Multilingual Support ✅

**Fully Implemented** with react-i18next:
- 🇧🇦 **Bosnian** (default) - Bosanski
- 🇬🇧 **English** - English
- 🇩🇪 **German** - Deutsch

All 13 pages and 260+ UI elements support language switching with persistent preference.
